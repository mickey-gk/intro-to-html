                 dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
                  moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that
                   are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                    through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from
                     toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
                      In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
                       prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                        welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing
                         to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently
                          occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
                           The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle
                            of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures,
                             or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
